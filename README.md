# Dyslipidemia-EHR
## Repository Structure
- **data_processing.py**: This file is responsible for data preprocessing. It includes functions for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the input data for modeling.

- **feature_extra.py**: This file is dedicated to feature extraction. It contains methods for extracting relevant features from the preprocessed data. These features are crucial for building the anomaly detection model.

- **modeling.py**: In this file, you will find the implementation of the dyslipidemia predict models. We use various machine learning and statistical techniques to develop models that can predict dyslipidemia.
